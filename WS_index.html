			<h3>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) marketing</h3>
			<p><span>PPC</span> (<a href="">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p><span>PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</p></li>
				<li><p><span>PPC Management</span> - <a href="">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="">paid search</a> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various apsects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="">online ad campaign</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>WordStream's <a href="">PPC software</a> is specifically designed to aid in these two <a href="">PPC search engine</a> marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
